1. Write a method called printReverse that accepts a string as its parameter and prints the characters in opposite
order. For example, a call of printReverse("hello there!") should print "!ereht olleh" . If the empty
string is passed, the method should produce no output.

2. Write a method called inputBirthday that accepts a Scanner for the console as a parameter and prompts the user
to enter a month, day, and year of birth, then prints the birthdate in a suitable format. Here is an example dialogue
with the user:
On what day of the month were you born? 8
What is the name of the month in which you were born? May
During what year were you born? 1981
You were born on May 8, 1981. You’re mighty old!

3. Write a method called triangleArea that accepts the three side lengths of a triangle as parameters and returns the
area of a triangle with those side lengths. For example, the call triangleArea(8, 5.2, 7.1) should return
18.151176098258745 . To compute the area, use Heron’s formula, which states that the area of a triangle whose
three sides have lengths a, b, and c, is the following. The formula is based on the computed value s, a length equal to
half the perimeter of the triangle:
area = 2s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)
a + b + c
s =
2
